## Tavern Ledger
Tavern Ledger is designed to be a medieval fantasy-inspired task management app. Instead of "tasks", you have "quests" and similar. I wanted this app to be a fun, lighthearted way to keep myself and others organized.  It is extremely work-in-progress as it is a side project of mine that I'm working on in my spare time. This app uses Next.js and MUI. 

### Goals
1. Create a CRUD application for task management
2. Add an authentication layer so individual users can maintain their quests across devices
3. Add support for both a list view and a board view
4. Expand app to include separate support for TTRPG campaign tracking for notes, quests, NPCs, and more
